# TABLEAU-ZOMATO-PROJECT

The Tableau dashboard presents a comprehensive analysis of Zomato restaurant data using interactive and visually rich charts. A country- and city-level map and bar charts display the geographical distribution of restaurants, helping identify high-density markets. Time-series visualizations analyze restaurant openings by year, quarter, and month using a calendar table, revealing growth patterns and seasonality. Rating-based charts show the distribution of restaurants across average rating categories to evaluate customer satisfaction. Price bucket visualizations segment restaurants into reasonable cost ranges, enabling analysis of affordability and pricing strategy. Percentage-based donut charts highlight the share of restaurants offering table booking and online delivery services. Additional bar charts analyze restaurant counts by cuisine and by city, allowing comparison of popular cuisines and major urban markets. Combined with filters and dashboard actions, these visuals enable dynamic exploration and deliver actionable business insights.
